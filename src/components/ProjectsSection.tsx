      title: "IoT Smart Meter: Remote Energy Management System",
      hook: "A comprehensive IoT solution that empowers users to monitor, control, and budget their electricity consumption in real-time through a dedicated mobile application.",
      challenge: "Traditional electricity meters provide no real-time data or control to the end-user, often leading to surprise bills and inefficient energy usage. The goal of my graduation project was to design and build the core hardware and firmware for a smart meter that could be controlled remotely, giving users direct power over their energy consumption.",
      role: "My primary responsibility was architecting and building the complete hardware and embedded firmware for the smart meter. This involved: Hardware Design & Integration using ESP32 microcontroller, interfacing high-power relay and voltage/current sensors. Firmware Development writing complete firmware from ground up in C++/Arduino including low-level sensor reading code. Control & Logic implementing relay control for safely connecting/disconnecting electricity supply. Connectivity & API Endpoint programming ESP32 for Wi-Fi connectivity and server communication, developing device-side API for mobile app integration.",
